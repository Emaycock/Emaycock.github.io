                    <h3>Bike Sales Data Analysis</h3>
                    <p>This project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a bike sales dataset in Excel. 
                        Key tasks included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating a dashboard that provides insights into bike purchases across various age groups, income levels, and commute distances. 
                        The final product is an intuitive, interactive dashboard that highlights key trends in customer behavior.

                    <h3>Vehicle Data Analysis and Dashboard:</h3>
                    <p>This project analyzes a vehicle dataset using Python and Tableau. After cleaning and transforming the data with Python and Pandas, I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize key metrics such as vehicle make, model, year, quantity, location, and MSRP. 
                        Additional metrics like battery type, battery range, and type of fuel were also analyzed, providing insights into vehicle energy efficiency and market trends. 
                        This dashboard enables a vehicle manufacturer to leverage data-driven insights to optimize sales strategies and maximize revenue potential</p>
